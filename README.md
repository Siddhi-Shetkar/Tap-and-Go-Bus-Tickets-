# Bus Ticket Booking System (DSA Project in C++)

## 📌 Overview
The **Bus Ticket Booking System** is a comprehensive C++ application designed to manage bus ticket bookings for intercity travel in India. This project demonstrates the application of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in solving real-world problems, including route management, seat booking, ticket generation, and user interaction.  

The system provides an interactive platform for users to:
- Select trips and view available buses
- Book seats and choose boarding/dropping points
- Generate unique ticket IDs
- Visualize bus seat layouts
- View recent bookings

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Managing bus tickets manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. Students and travelers often face challenges like:
- Finding available buses for a specific route and date
- Tracking booked and available seats
- Managing multiple bookings
- Generating unique tickets efficiently

This project automates the bus ticket booking process while integrating **data structures** to handle bookings efficiently.

## 💡 Features
- **Route Management:**  
  - Models bus routes as a **graph (adjacency list)** for path validation and route selection  
- **Seat Booking:**  
  - Manages booked seat numbers using **linked lists**  
  - Displays real-time bus **seat arrangement using vectors**  
- **Travel Date Management:**  
  - Organizes and validates travel dates using a **binary search tree (BST)**  
- **Ticket Generation:**  
  - Generates **unique ticket IDs using hashing**  
  - Maintains **recent bookings using a stack**  
- **Dynamic Pricing:**  
  - Calculates ticket price based on route, number of seats, and additional charges for window seats  
- **User Input Validation:**  
  - Validates phone number, age, boarding and dropping point selection  
- **Continuous Booking:**  
  - Allows multiple bookings in a loop until the user chooses to exit  
- **OOP Design:**  
  - Uses **structs and classes** in C++ for modularity and maintainability
